# Bitcoin Address Lookup CLI
Lookup a Bitcoin address in the Command Line.

## Usage
Run with:
```sh
python3 lookup.py address
```

This application is best used with aliasing, that way you can lookup an address from wherever as long as you are in your command line.
Example, I have an alias, "al" (address lookup) and thus it can be run:
al ADDRESS.

## Set up alias
This is somewhat different to all OSs and shells, I've found these tutorials online:  
[Mac](http://www.techradar.com/how-to/computing/apple/terminal-101-creating-aliases-for-commands-1305638)  
[Linux](http://www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/set-command-aliases-linuxubuntudebian/)  
[Windows](https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-set-aliases-for-the-command-prompt-in-windows/)  
Please note, I've not been able to try the Linux and the Windows version myself.
